#Create Database
##NOTE, for longest time I was getting the following error when trying to import my .csv file: Error Code: 1290. 
The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement. To solve that. I had to do the following##
## one thing that I also had to do was change settings and add a line of code to my SQL settings##

CREATE DATABASE Dustin;
CREATE TABLE newtablewithmartin (FirstName CHAR (20),
							LastName CHAR (20));
						
select * from newtablewithmartin; 


LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/Users/dustinhoye/Desktop/SQL/tablewithwill.csv'
#NOTE the code above is for a MAC. It will chagne on a PC



LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/Users/dustinhoye/Desktop/SQL/tablewithwill.csv'
INTO TABLE newtablewithmartin
COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;


SELECT * FROM newtablewithmartin;
